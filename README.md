# bga-skyteam
BGA adaptation for Sky Team

TODO:
- The preferences is the place for toggling help symbols, I would recommend leaving it as is

Changelog:
- I've made the communcation banner smaller, added a close button to it and a preference with 3 options: always visible, auto hide after 10 seconds & always hidden
- Spend coffee now shows "Use: 1" instead of "Cost: 1". I do not recommend moving the buttons to one side as that will make them really close together and that hurts the mobile experience.
- Resized the coffee tokens to actual size
- Made dice bigger
- If you win or lose the game, your screen is now scrolled to the end game info box
- The victory conditions rows now change background based on their status (completed: green, pending: gray, failure: red (only end of the game))
- Removed plane tokens are now moved to the left offscreen
- Fixed moving two spaces or one space if the value of the engine dice are equal to the orange marker.

# bga-skyteam
BGA adaptation for Sky Team

TODO:


DONE:
- is it really usefull to see the plane token removed? And the reroll token used? Why should we see them at the bottom ?
- and so, if we store the coffee token on the left of the cockpit (and not behind) we can have a bigger image/ view of the cockpit. A bit more comfortable.
- the "no communication" banner takes a lot of space on top of the screen AND is here during the briefing phase. I would suggest to put in in a square on the left or right of the tracks and to change it during the briefing phase to reflect the rules. (red title "no communication" during dice placement and green title "limited communication" during the briefing phase)

# bga-skyteam
BGA adaptation for Sky Team

TODO:
- If no placement, confirm end turn

Fixed bugs:
#99497: "Reroll animation not shown when a re-roll results in the same result"
#99598: "Mastery Card not activated in final round (while playing dice of same value on engines)"
#99310: "Inaccurate brake calculations"
#99306: "Kerosene marker does not show accurately on mobile."

Improvements:
#99316: "If only one die remaining for placement, it should auto select it"
#99500: "Highlight approach slot when using the radio action to indicate the slot where the plane is removed"
Adaption Special Ability now shows the players that have used it using checkmarks
When placing the second Axis die it now highlights what the new Axis will be (before confirming)

Please keep reporting bugs and suggestions.

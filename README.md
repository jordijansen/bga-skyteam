# bga-skyteam
BGA adaptation for Sky Team

TODO:
- If no placement, confirm end turn

Fixed bugs:
#101441: When you have the synchronization special ability you should be able to place dice on landing/flaps
#101435: The engine dice was not compared to the brake dice until the end of the round

Improvements:
#101605: When rerolling dice it should show a skip re-roll button for if you don't want to reroll any dice.


Please keep reporting bugs and suggestions.

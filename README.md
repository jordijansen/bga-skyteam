# bga-skyteam
BGA adaptation for Sky Team

IDEA: Make a forum post detailing this

NEW:
- Sky Team Turbulence!
- Safe Mode (#103446, #122010, #129442)
- Flight Log
- Speed Indicator
- New table option: Permanent Total Trust

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
- Preferences Menu! -> new backgrounds, helpful settings
- Revamped Welcome Screen!
- #119158: make approach track planes smaller when 4 or more in a slot, so they don't block crucial info. Hovering over the planes will make them transparent.
- #123866: Engine Loss module, you can no longer skip the mandatory placement on axis.
- #113881: Intern help dialog now correctly states the allowed values.
- #119898: Incorrect score for Budapest Yellow

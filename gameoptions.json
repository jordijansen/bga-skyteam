Wait... are those... PENGUINS?!<br /><br />A strong headwind from the Pole shakes your cargo and the few passengers you have aboard. Welcome to Antarctica. The ice in November is still thick enough to support a landing. This is the first time you\u2019ve seen the famous \u201cIce Runway\u201d with your own eyes. Landing an airliner in this remote location seems unreal. Wait... are those... penguins on the runway??",
